// Pure logic for the fleet-wide context guard (kanban #81).
//
// A Claude Code session that grows past its context window STALLS: near the
// limit the auto-compact request must ship the ENTIRE context (its most
// failure-prone request -- observed socket errors), the TUI parks behind
// "Resume from summary"/error banners, and nothing external notices. Three
// agents wedged this way on a single day (2026-07-09). The guard acts BEFORE
// that zone: at actPct it asks the agent to write a HANDOFF.md, then performs a
// FRESH restart and injects a resume prompt pointing at the handoff, so the
// agent continues on its own. At hardPct (or when the handoff never appears)
// it force-restarts anyway -- taskstate + kanban + hot memories are the
// fallback context.
//
// On top of the (opt-in) proactive tiers sits an ALWAYS-ON saturation net:
// once a pane reads "100% context used", prompt dispatch refuses it and the
// in-TUI auto-compact -- which only runs when a new turn starts -- can never
// fire, so without external action the agent is wedged forever (samu,
// 2026-07-18). The net fresh-restarts such a pane after a confirmation sweep.
//
// This module is dependency-free (no clock, tmux, or fs) so the state machine
// is unit-testable. The I/O lives in src/web/context-guard-runner.ts.

 * below); for the other 1M-family models (fable/mythos/opus) this number is
 * EXTRAPOLATED, not independently confirmed -- see the "TEMPORARY, UNVERIFIED
 * EXTRAPOLATION" paragraph further down for exactly what that does and does
 * not mean. Declared once
 * and reused everywhere a "1M-family" number is needed (contextLimitForModel's
 * two 1M-returning branches AND the CONTEXT_LIMIT_TIERS step-up target below),
 * so the two can never drift apart the way they did in an earlier draft of
 * this fix (a change to CONTEXT_LIMIT_TIERS alone silently did nothing,
 * because contextLimitForModel's [1m]/ONE_MILLION_FAMILIES branches returned
 * a separate hardcoded 1_000_000 that never consulted the tiers array).
 *
 * Measured DIRECTLY for claude-sonnet-5 only: the model's own live /context
 * readout ("Auto-compact window: 967k tokens", i.e. the 1_000_000 nominal
 * window minus a ~33k reserved compaction buffer), cross-checked on two
 * independent, currently-running sonnet-5 sessions (2026-09-05). For the
 * OTHER 1M-family models (fable/mythos/opus) this value is a TEMPORARY,
 * UNVERIFIED EXTRAPOLATION, not a confirmed number for those families -- their
 * own historical peak observations (see below, 976k/911k/985k-999k/979k) are a
 * DIFFERENT KIND of measurement (a successful session's high-water mark, not a
 * declared trigger point) and neither confirm nor contradict this figure; the
 * opus-4-8 985k-999k range in particular sits PARTLY ABOVE it. Re-verify per
 * family via that family's own live /context output once such an agent is
 * next running, and give it its own entry here if the number differs.
 *
 * Applying this figure fleet-wide (instead of only to sonnet-5) is a RELATIVE
 * improvement over today's production behavior, not a proof of absolute
 * safety: today every 1M-family agent's hard-restart threshold is
 * 0.97 * 1_000_000 = 970_000, which sits above 967_000 -- but 967_000 itself
 * is a value VERIFIED ONLY FOR SONNET-5, applied to the other families as an
 * unconfirmed shared denominator, not a measured per-family ceiling. So this
 * is not "970_000 is confirmed above every family's true ceiling"; it is
 * "970_000 is above the one number we are choosing to share across families",
 * and a family whose real ceiling is lower than that shared number could
 * still have its own uncontrolled auto-compact fire before our external
 * mechanism gets a turn. Moving the denominator down to 967_000 can only move
 * the external threshold EARLIER (938_000), never later -- if some family's
 * true ceiling turns out to be below 938_000, the external restart is still
 * late, just LESS late than the 970_000 it fires at today. This is not a
 * guarantee, only a bound improvement pending real per-family measurement.

 *                long tool call appends nothing to the transcript while it
 *                runs, so idleMs alone reads a working agent as quiet.
 *
 * paneIdle, not !paneBusy: a pane parked behind an error banner is neither,
 * and flushing one on the strength of a stale mtime would throw away whatever
 * state a human might still recover from it. The saturation net is the
