// Generic two-stage alert escalation: BÉLA first (inter-agent notice),
// Istvan only if BÉLA has had a chance to react and the problem is still
// there (direct Telegram). Istvan's standing rule (first stated 2026-08-29
// for the scheduler's pending-retry/task-timeout alerts, restated 2026-09-02
// for stuck-input-watcher.ts): "a rendszer sajat riasztasai elobb BELA-hoz
// menjenek, csak utana Istvanhoz ha nem oldodik meg" -- the system's OWN
// internal alerts go to BÉLA first, only to Istvan if unresolved.
//
// This module is the SHARED core for every call site that alerts about a
// SUB-AGENT or fleet-infrastructure problem (as opposed to BÉLA's own main
// channel/session breaking, where paging BÉLA first makes no sense -- see
// each call site's own comment for why it's exempt). Deliberately generic
// (a string key + two pre-built message strings) rather than tied to any
// one watcher's state shape, so 15 different sites across stuck-input-
// watcher.ts, channel-monitor.ts, agent-process.ts, and agent-worker.ts can
// all share ONE implementation instead of a dozen copies of the same
// two-stage logic (kanban cf12a93a). This is the module's THIRD design
// iteration -- see the two sections below for what each review round found
// and why the shape changed each time. Read both before touching this file.
//
// ---- Round 2 (2026-09-02): timer-driven, NOT re-invocation-driven ----
// The first version evaluated "is stage 2 due" only inside escalateToOwner
// itself -- so stage 2 could only fire if a caller happened to call
// escalateToOwner AGAIN, later, for the same key. Several call sites are
// demand-driven (agent-worker.ts's alertWorkerStuck fires only when someone
// dispatches a worker task; agent-process.ts's maybeAlertSharedConfigCollision
// only on a sub-agent spawn attempt; two of channel-monitor.ts's channel-
// down alerts wrap escalateToOwner in their own pre-existing one-shot
// gates) -- for those, if nothing re-triggered the check, stage 2 would
// NEVER fire, no matter how long the problem lasted. Fixed by giving each
// key a real, cancelable Node timer scheduled the moment stage 1 succeeds,
// independent of whether the caller calls escalateToOwner again.
// Also fixed in the same round: stage2At used to stamp unconditionally
// (notifyChannel swallows send failures and never rejects) -- now routed
// through notifyChannelOrThrow (src/notify.ts) and only stamped on a
// CONFIRMED successful send, with classifyTelegramSendError (reused from
// pending-retries.ts) distinguishing a transient failure (retry soon) from
// a permanent one (back off harder, keep trying in case the config gets
// fixed mid-incident).
//
// ---- Round 3 (2026-09-02): the SAME re-invocation gap existed for stage 1
// too, one step earlier -- plus the send path itself could hang forever ----
// Two more real gaps, found reviewing the round-2 fix:
//   (1) If createAgentMessage (the stage-1 BÉLA notice) threw on a demand-
//       driven site's ONLY invocation, nothing retried -- the exact same
//       lost-escalation pattern the round-2 timer fixed for stage 2, just
//       one step earlier in the sequence, and the round-2 fix did nothing
//       for it.
//   (2) src/channel-provider.ts's telegramHttpPost had NO timeout at all
//       (raw https.request, no req.setTimeout/AbortController) -- a stalled
//       TCP connection would leave notifyChannelOrThrow's promise pending
//       forever, which round 2's fireStage2 now AWAITs directly. Fixed
//       separately in channel-provider.ts (TOOL_TIMEOUTS['telegram'], the
//       same 10s deadline src/web/telegram.ts's sendTelegramMessage already
//       uses) -- but even with that fix, THIS module still needed its own
//       retry-on-failure story for stage 1, which it never had.
//
// Fixed by unifying stage 1 and stage 2 into ONE recurring, self-scheduling
// tick per key (`_tick`), rather than two separately-shaped mechanisms:
//   - stage1At === null: attempt the BÉLA notice. Success -> stamp
//     stage1At, schedule the stage-2 tick after stage2ExtraMs. Failure ->
//     schedule a SHORT retry (STAGE1_RETRY_MS) and increment an attempt
//     counter; after STAGE1_MAX_ATTEMPTS consecutive failures, GIVE UP on
//     reaching BÉLA and fire the direct owner alert immediately instead
//     (clearly labeled as a BÉLA-unreachable fallback, not a normal
//     "BÉLA was notified" stage-2 message -- see FALLBACK_PREFIX) so
//     Istvan is still guaranteed to learn about it even if the inter-agent
//     notice path itself is broken.
//   - stage1At set, stage2At === null: attempt the direct owner alert (same
//     success/transient/permanent retry logic as round 2).
//   - stage2At set: nothing left to do, no further ticks.
// A single call to escalateToOwner is now sufficient to drive the ENTIRE
// sequence to completion (or a labeled give-up) on its own, regardless of
// whether the caller invokes it again -- closing the gap for both stages
// at all 15 sites without needing any site's own outer gate touched.
//
// ---- decideOwnerEscalation (pure predicate) is NOT what drives live timing
// ---- (documentation correction, round 3 point a)
// An earlier version of this comment implied shouldSendAlert/
// decideOwnerEscalation governed the production stage-2 decision by reuse.
// That stopped being true once the timer/tick design landed: the pure
// function below is kept as an independently useful, independently tested
// predicate (and its own tests still exercise the shouldSendAlert reuse
// directly), but escalateToOwner/`_tick` do not call it -- the timers
// scheduled by setTimeout are what actually drives stage-1/stage-2 timing
// in production now. Do not assume changing decideOwnerEscalation's
// thresholds affects live behavior; DEFAULT_STAGE2_EXTRA_MS does.
//
// ---- Process-local state, not persisted (documented tradeoff, unchanged
// from round 2) ----
// escalationState and all pending timers are in-memory only, lost on a
// dashboard restart (this happened multiple times the same day this module
// was built). Deliberately NOT persisted to disk/DB -- these watchers
// detect and resolve on a 1-5 minute scale, and a persisted version would
// need its own startup-recovery/replay logic, real complexity
// disproportionate to that window. The residual risk is a genuine,
// asymmetric PRODUCT RISK, not a "small window" to wave off (round 3 point
// c pushed back on that framing, correctly):
//   - Periodic-sweep sites (stuck-input-watcher.ts, most of channel-
//     monitor.ts) self-heal within one sweep interval after a restart -- a
//     few seconds to a minute of extra delay, not a lost incident.
//   - Demand-driven sites (agent-worker.ts's alertWorkerStuck, agent-
//     process.ts's maybeAlertSharedConfigCollision): if a restart happens
//     while an escalation is in flight, that SPECIFIC incident's
//     escalation state is gone, and recovery depends entirely on whether
//     that site's own natural trigger (a worker dispatch attempt, a
//     sub-agent spawn attempt) happens to recur afterward -- which, per
//     Codex's own example, could be never for a rarely-used worker
//     function. This is a real, standing gap for those two sites
//     specifically, not a rounding error. Closing it properly would mean
//     giving those two watchers their own dedicated periodic re-check
//     (turning them from demand-driven into periodic-sweep, matching every
//     OTHER site this module serves) -- a real architecture addition to
//     files this card did not otherwise need to touch, flagged as a
//     concrete follow-up rather than bundled into this pass.
//
// ---- Key-space is bounded, so no TTL/prune (round 3 point d) ----
// Considered adding a TTL/prune for stale Map entries (e.g. the
// agent-worker.ts key, which can sit in a 30-minute permanent-failure retry
// loop indefinitely if the underlying problem never resolves and nobody
// calls clearOwnerEscalation). Not implemented: every key in production is
// `${literal-prefix}:${session}` (or a single bare global literal) where
// `session` is drawn from a small, FIXED set (the fleet's own agent/worker
// names -- see listAgentNames()/the two hardcoded WorkerCtx sessions in
// agent-worker.ts), never user-controlled or dynamically generated per
// request. The Map's size is therefore inherently bounded by the fleet's
// own size regardless of how long any single entry survives; a stale entry
// retrying every 30 minutes against a permanently broken config is exactly
// the intended "keep trying in case it gets fixed" behavior, not a leak.
// Revisit if a future call site ever keys on something unbounded (e.g. a
// per-message or per-user identifier).
