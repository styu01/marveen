// Worker-session liveness instrument (WORKERBOOT1) + auto-restart (2026-08-16,
// Istvan-reported gap: watchdog.sh only covers "<agent>-channels" and the
// per-agent sub-agent sessions in agents/*/, never the two interactive
// "<MAIN_AGENT_ID>-worker" / "-worker-fast" sessions -- so if Bela's own
// worker session dies while the dashboard stays up, NOTHING proactively brings
// it back. It only self-healed reactively, the next time someone happened to
// message Bela (runViaWorker's own mid-request restart) -- if nobody did, it
// stayed dead indefinitely and silently.
//
// The two interactive worker sessions are pre-started once at boot; before this
// change nothing looked at them again in between requests: channel-monitor.ts
// does not know about workers, and workerSessionExists() was used solely for
// start-time idempotency and the in-request poll.
//
// Measured on a live host 2026-07-30: both sessions were created at 11:42
// (two "launched interactive worker session" lines, which only run AFTER a
// successful tmux new-session), and by 18:00 neither existed -- with zero log
// lines about them in between.
//
// This module still does not try to EXPLAIN the death (see the death-log doc
// below) -- with no record of when or how they die, any diagnosis would be a
// guess. But it now ALSO restarts: every sweep that finds a session missing
// calls the canonical startWorkerSession() (agent-worker.ts, the exact
// function the boot pre-start uses) -- not a re-derived launch command here.
// startWorkerSession() is idempotent (checks tmux has-session per context) and
// already respects the WEB_ONLY gate internally, so calling it unconditionally
// on every "not alive" sweep is safe and requires no new gating in this file.
// Restart is attempted every tick the session is missing (not just once on the
// death transition) so a failed attempt is retried on the next poll instead of
// leaving the worker down until the next external event.
//
// The pane cannot be read post mortem (the session is gone), so each poll keeps
// the last pane seen while the worker was still alive, and the death log
// reports that snapshot.
