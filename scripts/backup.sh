# --- Encryption (2026-09-10, kanban e5c6ce03) -------------------------------
# A verified PLAINTEXT archive is written and retained locally, exactly as
# before (Output/Retention below). A SEPARATE, GPG AES256-encrypted copy of
# that SAME already-verified archive is then produced and published to
# BACKUP_DEST_ROOT/encrypted -- meant to be a Drive-synced folder Istvan
# designates via the BACKUP_DEST_ROOT env var (defaults to the local backups/
# dir when unset, i.e. encryption-only with no off-machine copy). The
# encryption step re-verifies itself independently (decrypt + byte-identical
# cmp against the plaintext archive) before publishing or pruning anything --
# a failed encryption pass never touches the plaintext backup or its own
# prior encrypted archives.
#
# The passphrase lives OUTSIDE this repo and OUTSIDE any backed-up directory
# (BACKUP_PASSPHRASE_FILE, default ~/.marveen-backup-passphrase) -- see the
# validation block below. It is never read into a shell variable; gpg reads
# it directly via --passphrase-file, and this script never echoes or logs it.
#
# Output: backups/claudeclaw-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.tar.gz (plaintext, local)
#         BACKUP_DEST_ROOT/encrypted/claudeclaw-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.tar.gz.gpg
# Retention: keeps the most recent 14 of EACH, pruned independently.
#
# Restore (preserve modes so the 0600 token files stay private):
#   plaintext:  tar -xpzf <archive> -C /tmp/restore
#   encrypted:  gpg --batch --no-tty --pinentry-mode loopback \
#                 --passphrase-file <passphrase-file> --decrypt <archive>.gpg \
#                 | tar -xpzf - -C /tmp/restore
#   then copy repo/* into the project root and home/* into $HOME.

# file/dir created from here on; the explicit chmod calls below are

# outgoing-copy-gate-rules.json, watchdog-userbot state, ...] THE FIRST TIME

#
# Round 2 (Codex): a denylist covering ALL top-level entries (files AND

# unnoticed directory at store/ top-level (a model/ML cache, a venv, a
# browser profile, a generated export dump) gets swept in WHOLESALE by
# default, risking a multi-GB archive, a slow run, or a full disk. A FIFO,
# socket, or device special file (also unfiltered by a bare `find -mindepth
# 1 -maxdepth 1`) could additionally hang `cp -pR` outright. So the two

#   - regular files + symlinks: DENYLIST (auto-included unless explicitly
#     excluded below) -- these are what state/credential files actually are,
#     and a stray large *file* is comparatively rare and easy to add to the
