"""
telegram_progress_watchdog.py -- the "őrszem" (sentry) for the Telegram progress
indicator. Runs independently of the agent sessions (via launchd/systemd), so it
can speak even when an agent is wedged or down.

Problem it solves: the UserPromptSubmit hook posts a "✍️ Dolgozom rajta…"
placeholder; the Stop hook deletes it when the turn ends. If a turn never ends
(agent crashed, session killed, or WEDGED on a dropped MCP reply-tool call that
never returns), the placeholder would sit there forever and the user is left
wondering "is it working or broken?".

Two delivery modes, best-effort per pending placeholder:
  - REAL ANSWER (preferred): if the agent's final answer is recoverable from the
    transcript, deliver it for real (sendMessage) and remove the placeholder --
    the same answer the Stop hook's guaranteed fallback would have sent, but
    without waiting for a turn end that may never come. This is the fix for the
    "reply tool dropped mid-turn -> round hangs -> Stop hook never fires ->
    the owner has to restart" freeze: the user gets the actual answer, restart-free.
  - GENERIC ERROR (fallback): if no answer is recoverable, rewrite the
    placeholder into a clear error (editMessageText), as before.

Detection (per pending placeholder ENTRY -- see TGORPHANFILE908 below for why
this is entry-level, not file-level):
  - agent DOWN (its tmux `agent-<name>` session is gone) and the placeholder is
    older than DOWN_GRACE_SEC -> fire (crash / unreachable), or
  - agent UP but the transcript shows a HUNG reply -- the most recent tool call
    is the Telegram `reply` and it has no result yet -- and the placeholder is
    older than WEDGED_UP_SEC -> fire FAST. This precisely targets the dropped-
    MCP freeze and does NOT misfire on a legitimately long task (which has no
    dangling reply call), so the threshold can be far below the blunt backstop.
  - agent UP with no hung-reply signal but the placeholder is older than
    WEDGED_SEC -> fire (blunt backstop for genuinely stuck turns; generous so
    long legit tasks aren't cut short).
  - placeholder older than STALE_SEC (default 24h) -> DEAD round: deliver
    nothing, drop the marker (and the placeholder message while Telegram still
    allows deletion). TGORPHAN908: without this bound a post-outage scan walked
    28-day orphans into the backstop and sent internal work logs to the owner.

The recovered answer is scoped to the round that posted the placeholder (see
read_transcript): the transcript keeps growing after that round, so its last
text may be a later internal turn's monologue -- never deliverable here.

TGORPHANFILE908 (2026-09-09, found in Codex review of TGORPHAN908): the state
file is keyed by session_id, NOT by placeholder, and telegram_progress.py
APPENDS a fresh entry to the SAME file when an earlier one is still pending
(Stop hook never fired for it). That means one `*.json` file can hold several
entries from DIFFERENT rounds, and every append bumps the FILE's mtime --
which used to be the only age signal this watchdog had. A fresh append could
therefore mask an old orphan sitting right next to it in the same array (the
file always "looks" recently touched), and -- worse -- age/turn_start/answer
were computed ONCE per file and applied to every entry in it, so an old
orphan could inherit a brand-new round's answer outright. Every entry now
carries its own `created_at` (stamped by telegram_progress.py) and is aged,
scoped and delivered INDEPENDENTLY of its file-mates; the file's mtime is
used only as a last-resort age estimate for entries written before this field
existed (see the fail-closed legacy path in handle_dir), and even then it
never gates a transcript-derived answer.

Standalone: scans every agent's per-agent telegram state dir. No marveen src
dependency; only Python stdlib + the `tmux` binary. Bot API base is overridable
via TELEGRAM_API_BASE (tests point it at a local stub).
