"""
usage-monitor heartbeat short-circuit check (kanban 240e6747, 2026-09-12).

The usage-monitor scheduled task (cron 0,30 * * * *) re-reads
store/usage-latest.json and re-evaluates the pause/stop thresholds on EVERY
run -- even when nothing about the underlying usage state or pause status
has changed since the previous run. This script gives that heartbeat's
USAGE-SPECIFIC logic (NOT the stuck-menu scan -- see the note below) a
cheap, deterministic early-exit signal.

IMPORTANT DEVIATION FROM THE LITERAL REQUEST #1, documented per KISPROGI's
own "say so, don't silently build the wrong thing" rule: the request as
phrased ("ha a generated_at mezo NEM valtozott") would compare
usage-latest.json's own `generated_at` timestamp VALUE. That field is
unconditionally re-stamped to `now` by scripts/usage-collect.py's
build_snapshot() on EVERY run of its own 5-minute cron, REGARDLESS of
whether the underlying quota numbers moved. Since this heartbeat runs every
30 minutes (6x the collector's own cadence), generated_at is virtually
guaranteed to differ between any two consecutive heartbeat runs -- comparing
it verbatim would make this short-circuit a permanent no-op. This script
instead compares the MEANINGFUL fields: claude.source, both window
used_percent/resets_at values, a normalized view of store/.usage-fleet-pause,
AND (Codex review, 2026-09-12, 1st round) a FRESHNESS CLASS derived from
generated_at (fresh: <=15min old, matching the original prompt's own
staleness threshold; stale: older; missing/invalid otherwise) -- the class,
never the raw timestamp. This closes the gap the first draft had: without
tracking freshness at all, a FROZEN collector (crashed but its last output
file still sitting there with old-but-otherwise-unchanged numbers) would
short-circuit FOREVER and the heartbeat's own stale-episode handling (which
depends on noticing >15min staleness) would never get to run even once.

IMPORTANT DEVIATION #2 (Codex review, 2026-09-12, 1st round): the original
draft of this short-circuit also gated the heartbeat's STUCK-MENU tmux scan
behind the same skip/proceed decision. That scan is a separate, explicitly
"kotelezo" (mandatory) safety control introduced 2026-07-24 after a real
incident (an agent stuck in an interactive menu for hours undetected) and
widened to full fleet coverage 2026-09-08 after a SECOND such incident. It
must not silently start skipping runs as a side effect of a usage-tracking
optimization. The scan has been extracted into its own, always-running
scheduled task ("stuck-menu-scan") and is no longer part of usage-monitor's
prompt at all -- this script's skip/proceed verdict now only ever affects
the usage-specific portion of that heartbeat.

Prints exactly one line to stdout:
  USAGE_MONITOR_SKIP    -- nothing meaningful changed since the last run;
                           the heartbeat prompt should stop here, no further
                           tool calls for the usage-tracking logic.
  USAGE_MONITOR_PROCEED -- something changed (or this is the first run ever,
                           or the state could not be read/written) -- run
                           the full existing usage logic unchanged.

Always overwrites the last-check state file with what THIS run observed,
regardless of the verdict, so the NEXT run compares against it. Any
unexpected error (Codex review: e.g. an OSError writing the state file)
fails toward PROCEED, never toward a silent, unverifiable SKIP -- an
untracked exception must not look identical to "nothing changed".

Store paths default to the live checkout but can be overridden via env vars
for isolated testing (USAGE_MONITOR_LATEST_PATH / USAGE_MONITOR_PAUSE_PATH /
USAGE_MONITOR_LAST_CHECK_PATH) -- this script never needs a database
connection or network access, so it is trivially runnable against a scratch
copy of the three files without touching the live store/ at all.
